♻️ E-Waste Management Web Application
The E-Waste Management Web Application is a clean, responsive, and informative website developed with the purpose of raising awareness about electronic waste (e-waste). In today’s rapidly evolving digital world, electronic devices become obsolete quickly, and users often dispose of them irresponsibly. This has led to an alarming increase in e-waste, posing serious risks to both the environment and human health.
This web application serves as an awareness and guidance platform that educates users about proper e-waste disposal and recycling methods. It encourages eco-friendly practices and helps reduce the environmental footprint caused by unmanaged electronic waste.
The website features an intuitive interface with various sections that display educational content and visuals. Additionally, a login system has been implemented using PHP to demonstrate user-specific functionality and build a base for future personalization and data tracking.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 – For building the basic structure and content of web pages
CSS3 – For styling, layout, and responsive design
PHP – For backend processing and handling the login feature
XAMPP – As the local development server to run PHP scripts and host the site locally
Images & Visual Assets – To make the platform more engaging and informative

🚀 How to Set Up and Run the Project
To test and run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:
Step 1: Install XAMPP
Download and install XAMPP from https://www.apachefriends.org. XAMPP provides Apache, PHP, and other components needed to run PHP web apps.

Step 2: Place Project in htdocs
Copy the project folder into the htdocs directory of your XAMPP installation. For example:
C:/xampp/htdocs/project

Step 3: Start Apache Server
Open the XAMPP Control Panel and click Start next to Apache. Ensure it turns green, which means your server is running.

Step 4: Access the Web App
Open a browser and go to:

arduino
http://localhost/project/index.html
You should now see the homepage of your E-Waste Management application. You can navigate through pages, view visuals, and test the login functionality.

✅ Make sure Apache is running and that PHP files are correctly processed by the server.
👤 Target Audience
This platform is designed to be informative and beneficial for:
Individuals who want to learn about safe disposal of electronic waste
Students and educators in environmental science and sustainability
NGOs and local authorities working in waste management
Eco-conscious citizens who wish to reduce their digital footprint

🔮 Future Enhancement: Machine Learning Integration
To make the application more intelligent and user-interactive, we are working on integrating Machine Learning (ML) capabilities in the next phase of development.
🧠 Planned Features:
Users will be able to upload images of electronic items (e.g., mobile phones, batteries, wires)
An ML model (likely built using Python, TensorFlow, or Keras) will process the uploaded image
The model will detect and classify the type of e-waste based on the visual input
Based on the classification, the system can offer tips on safe disposal, recycling centers, or reuse options

🌟 Why This Matters:
This ML-based image recognition system will significantly improve the usability of the platform. It removes the burden from users of having to know what type of item they are disposing. Instead, the system will assist them in quickly identifying and managing their e-waste in an eco-friendly manner.
This planned feature transforms the web app from a static informational tool into a smart, interactive assistant for e-waste management — aligning with global efforts toward sustainability and green technology.
